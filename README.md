# Mac Setup

## A foreword

I am a mac app enthusiast who really enjoys trying new apps to see what best fits into my workflow. This originally started as, and still remains a reference for me when I setup a new computer, but I hope this helps others find what they need without having to  try everything. For the apps listed below, I was not compensated in any way. These are just the apps I use on a daily basis or use to use in the past. I try to prefer free solutions but occassionally I end up coming across a nice deal for a paid app which I can purchase at a price that is affordable. I try to avoid subscriptions unless I absolutely have to. I think the most expensive app I have purchased is Alfred. 

Anyone who wants can buy me a 📘️ or 🍺️ or app on https://www.buymeacoffee.com/viralshah. I plan on creating a complete website to showcase these in the near future and try out new apps that I hear about.

### Password Managemnt 🏆️

Investing in a good password manager is the one thing everyone should take away from this list. It is incredibly important that everyone uses safe, secure, and unique passwords across all their accounts. Humans are terrible at memorizing snippets of random numbers, characters, and symbols, and we compensate by taking shortcuts which can be exploited. It doesn't matter if you go with LastPass, 1Password, Enpass, BitWarden, Dashlane, etc; anything, just please use something. Most password managers are quite affordable, or have free limited trials. Here are my personal recommendations

* Enpass: Offline cloud agnostic password manager https://www.enpass.io/ ⭐️ | 💰️💰️ or 💰️ 🔄
  * Bitwarden: Open source password manager https://bitwarden.com/ 🏆️ | ❤️ or 💰️ 🔄
* Authy: 2FA manager https://authy.com/ ⭐️ 🏆️ | ❤️

### Compression & Encryption

The default compression app "Archive Utility" is good, but still lacking in terms of some advanced features. There are plenty of compression apps avaliable on the market, I am partial to the ones below. Keka is a beautiful app, while BetterZip provides a way to preview the contents of a directory.

* Encrypto: Securily encrypt files and folders with a password https://macpaw.com/encrypto ❤️

### File Management

Working with files is at the heart of what we do on a day to day basis. Finder is great, but there are certain features which are missing. Features like having 2 panes for easy drag and drop and a shelf collect all the files your want without having to click and hold are indespensible.

### Maintenance & Cleanup

There is a constant debate on whether or not you need keep your  mac meticiulousely clean. Whether it's enough to drag an application to the trash to uninstall it or if you should remove all the files it leaves behind. I am partial to the latter methodology.

### Utilities

These are some very powerful utilities which can make your mac behave more of how you would want it to. They serve very specific but common usecases.

_A word about Alfred. Is is an incredible powerful app, and an incredibly expensive one as well. The freemium version is a great place to start and I strongly reccomend it. Take a look at the "Powerpack" it has features which overlap with several other apps. I personally bought it and use several of the features but you can get similar features from a collection of other free and paid apps as well._
